# This repo will hold my python code that I'll be writing
# as part of the Coursera Introduction to Interactive 
# Programming in Python, April 2013.

# Tried to integrate with openshift, but found some 
# problems with updating that repo.  Will leave it
# like this for now.  Hopefully later on when I get
# more experience with it all, I'll put this code into
# OpenShift, python-aludwar.rhcloud.com
